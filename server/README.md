* **`sameSite: "lax"`** → Cookies are sent on **same-site requests** and also on **top-level GET navigations** from another site.
  ✅ Works for most normal cases (including your localhost frontend → backend).
  ❌ Not sent for cross-site `POST/PUT/DELETE` requests.

* **`sameSite: "strict"`** → Cookies are sent **only if the request comes from the exact same site**.
  ✅ Strongest CSRF protection.
  ❌ Breaks login/session if user comes from a different site or even a link click (unless already on same site).
Good catch 👍 That phrase can be confusing if you’re just diving into cookies.

## 🔹 “Top-level GET requests”

A **top-level request** = a navigation where the **browser’s address bar URL changes** (like when you click a link, type in a URL, or refresh).

* Example:

  * User on `google.com` clicks a link to `yourapp.com/profile`.
  * Browser navigates directly to `yourapp.com/profile`.
  * That’s a **top-level request**.

And **if it’s a GET request**, then cookies with `SameSite=Lax` **are sent**.

---

## 🔹 Example Scenarios

1. **Click a link (GET navigation)**

   * `google.com → yourapp.com` (via `<a href="...">`).
   * ✅ Cookies with `SameSite=Lax` **will be sent**.

2. **Submit a form with `method="GET"`**

   * `other.com` → `yourapp.com/search?q=test`.
   * ✅ Cookies with `SameSite=Lax` **will be sent**.

3. **Submit a form with `method="POST"`**

   * `other.com` → `yourapp.com/login`.
   * ❌ Cookies with `SameSite=Lax` **not sent**, only `SameSite=None`.

4. **AJAX/fetch from another site**

   * React app at `frontend.com` calls `api.com` with `fetch()`.
   * ❌ Cookies with `SameSite=Lax` **not sent**, only `SameSite=None`.

---

👉 TL;DR:

* **`lax` = practical default** (safe + works for most flows).
* **`strict` = super secure but can break UX** (rarely used in real apps).

Would you like me to also explain with a **real-world login flow example** how `lax` vs `strict` behaves differently?

---

## **browsers decide “same-site” based on the *registrable domain***, not the port.


### 🔹 Example: Localhost with different ports

* Frontend → `http://localhost:3000`
* Backend → `http://localhost:5000`

✅ For the browser, **both are considered the “same site”** because the domain is the same (`localhost`).
The port difference **doesn’t matter** for `sameSite`.

So:

* With `sameSite: "lax"` → your cookie **will be sent** from frontend → backend, even on different ports.
* With `sameSite: "strict"` → it will still work too (since domain = `localhost`).

---

### 🔹 Example: Different domains

* Frontend → `http://myfrontend.com`
* Backend → `http://myapi.com`

❌ Here, `lax` will **not work**, because they’re different domains. You’d need:

```ts
sameSite: "none",
secure: true
```

---

## ✅ TL;DR

* `http://localhost:3000` ↔ `http://localhost:5000` → **`lax` works fine**.
* `frontend.com` ↔ `api.com` → must use **`none` + `secure: true` (HTTPS)**.

---

👉 Do you want me to also give you a **ready Express config** that switches between

* `sameSite: "lax"` + `secure: false` for **dev (localhost)**
* `sameSite: "none"` + `secure: true` for **production (different domains)**
  automatically?
